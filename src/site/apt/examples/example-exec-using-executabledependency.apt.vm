Using Executable Binary Dependencies Instead of Local Executables

  Instead of invoking a locally installed binary executable (identified by <<<executable>>>), a dependency (identified by <<<executableDependency>>>) can directly get executed instead.
  This particularly is useful when the dependency is an executable binary like <<<.exe>>> or <<<.bat>>> file produced by a different Maven project which got deployed into a repository.
  The binary gets pulled to the local repository and is getting executed <<right there>> without the need to know its actual file name or location on disk: Just the GA coordinates (<<<groupId>>>, <<<artifactId>>>) are needed.
  Hence the <<<executable>>> parameter has to be omitted in favor of the <<<executableDependency>>> parameter.

  There are two ways of using executable binary dependencies: Project dependencies and plugin dependencies. Currently the <<<exec>>> goal only supports plugin dependencies.

* Plugin Dependencies

  Plugin Dependencies are referenced from within the plugin configuration.

** pom.xml

        <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        ...
        <configuration>
          <executableDependency>
            <!-- REFERENCES plugin dependency, see declaration below -->
            <groupId>your-group</groupId>
            <artifactId>your-artifact</artifactId>
          </executableDependency>
        </configuration>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <!-- DECLARES plugin dependency, see reference above -->
            <groupId>your-group</groupId>
            <artifactId>your-artifact</artifactId>
            <type>exe</type>
            <version>your-version</version>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>    
        ...
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
