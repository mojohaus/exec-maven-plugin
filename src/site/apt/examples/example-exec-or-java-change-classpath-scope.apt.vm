Changing the classpath scope when running Java programs

  Whether you use the <<<java>>> goal or the special support of Java for the <<<exec>>> goal, you might want
  to change the scope of the plugin execution. This can be achieved using the <<<classpathScope>>> configuration element,
  e.g. for a <<<test>>> scope:

-------------------
        <configuration>
          ...
          <classpathScope>test</classpathScope>
          ...
        </configuration>
-------------------

  or, on the command line,

-----
mvn exec:java [...] -Dexec.classpathScope="test"
-----
