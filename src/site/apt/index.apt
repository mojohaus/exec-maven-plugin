 The plugin provides 2 goals to help execute system and Java programs.

* Goals Overview

  General information about the goals.

  * {{{./exec-mojo.html}exec:exec}} execute programs and Java programs in a separate process.

  * {{{./java-mojo.html}exec:java}} execute Java programs in the same VM.

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Exec Maven Plugin can be found on the {{{./usage.html}usage page}}.

  free to contact the {{{./mailing-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
